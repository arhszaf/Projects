This project demonstrates the implementation of an AdaBoost classifier using a custom
implementation and compares it with the scikit-learn implementation on the IMDb movie reviews dataset.
he dataset is preprocessed to exclude the **`n`** most frequent and __k__ most rare words to
form a vocabulary of _`m`_ words. The performance is evaluated based on various metrics including 
training and test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
