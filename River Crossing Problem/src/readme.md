# A* Search Algorithm for River Crossing Problem 
 
This project implements the A* search algorithm to solve the river crossing problem. The program 
allows users to input the number of people,the total allowed crossing time, and the individual 
crossing times for each person. It then finds the optimal sequence of crossings to get everyone 
across the river within the specified time using the A* algorithm.

## Overview
The river crossing problem involves getting a group of people across a river with a limited amount of time and a boat that can carry a limited number of people at a time. 
Each person has a different crossing time, and the goal is to find the optimal sequence of crossings to minimize the total time taken.
